    Persistence is my most important value, as it is what will allow one to accomplish, or not accomplish, ones goals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Anyone can spend a few hours learning something, anyone can fiddle around with an idea they picked up for a day. Few will commit to any one particular idea.
    </p>
    <p>
    Plenty of people see this world full of buildings, ideas, hobbies, etc. and they think to themselves that something in particular is cool and they want to do it. They pick it up, try it out, set it down a day later, and may not even remember doing it. I know this because there's plenty of times I've picked up something to try it.
    </p>
    <p>
    There's been many times where I've felt I was going to be something in particular, a doctor as part of a medical community, a psychologist, a lawyer, an artist, a musician. So many ideas that I wanted to define myself as, but none of them realities because I never stuck to the idea. Perhaps that was a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
    But, that being said, the ideas I have stuck to, I have moved forward in. I have stuck to programming, and sticking with this has allowed me to essentially launch, and the fuel will only exist for my ship if I keep burning what's required to sustain and propel it, and the things that I burn are motivation, stress, enthusiasm, which culminates into effort, which, when applied daily, becomes persistence, and that persistence in turn becomes will power.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have kept on my current path for a good many months now, and it is scary at times to think of how quickly I could fall, because it's very easy to forget what you've learned until you've experienced it enough, and it's very easy to fall from the tower you've built, and hard to pick yourself back up again, so I guess in a sense, the tower, while scary as an idea to fall from, also encourages me to keep building, so that I don't suffer the pain of regret and not making what I want to accomplish happen.
