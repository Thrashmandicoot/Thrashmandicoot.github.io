  <h1>Culture Post Week 1</h1>
  <h2>Interview with my Expectations of DBC</h2>
  <h4>May 3rd, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <h3>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?</h3>
    <p>
      It's very exciting, seems like something that you not only build yourself on, but something that you get to contribute and make changes to.
    </p>


    <h3>What is your impression of DBC so far?</h3>
    <p>
      It's very fast paced, lots of new concepts, and even some old ones for me that are being expanded a lot faster than I'd normally "peruse" something myself. I like that though, it's a timeframe to push myself to strive on and challenge myself with.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm going to take it as an opportunity to challenge myself to think and grow big. Small, consistent steps, big vision, and changes and hard work to accomplish that. I'm looking to participate, engage with others and put myself out there as much as I can.
    </p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes. Before getting into the program, I had ideas and thoughts about what it could be, but nothing solid or permeable. Now that it's here, it's almost like a punch to the face (in a good way) and something that's like "ok, you gotta get this shit done today"
    </p>

    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm very excited, and nervous. I know that in the process of change, there's a parable comparing people to carving out changes in themselves as if their body is cast in marble. Change is never a pleasant process, but we grow to persist through that change, embrace it, and become more than we once were, and I'm really excited for that on my new path.
