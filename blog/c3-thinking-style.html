    <h2>Reflection on work strategies</h2>
    <h3>What has been the biggest struggle for you?</h3>
    <p>
      My biggest struggle in learning has been getting my brain to shut up.
      Each and every day, we manage the stress of being alive. There's bills,
      friends and the social contracts and consequences that come with them.
      It can take a lot of brain power to deal with incoming situations, and
      when it comes to getting things done, my brain likes to dwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      My brain enjoys thinking about the abstract, and all the possibilities and
      resolutions to problems. While this is effective when it comes to navigating
      beyond walls, it's very ineffective when working on deadlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've found that if I give myself directives, such as "I'm going to do this, then
      this, then that" I'll succesfully complete the task at hand. I've further
      found that meditation can really help calm my mind on current resource hogging
      thoughts, and that allows me to refocus on what's important
    </p>
    <p>
      All in all, I believe my strategies are working. It's a matter of being persistent
      and like all habits, I have some hiccups at about the 2nd week in. But we're still
      going strong and I'm going to continue to push myself to keep meditating, keep
      up with the workload, and eventually thriving.
