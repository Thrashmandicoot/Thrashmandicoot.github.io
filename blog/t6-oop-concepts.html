    <h2>Scopes and how to use</h2>

<h3>Global</h3>
<p>
The first is the $global variable represented by a $ sign, global in scope means it’s accessible throughout all of your application. The advantage is all around usability, the problem is that the global variable can easily be changed, and changes to it can be hard to track down. It’s best to only use a global variable in rare situations where something is consistently used throughout your app, and even then, maybe try to figure out another way to accomplish that functionality.
</p>
<h3>Constant</h3>
<p>
The second type is the Constant, the CONSTANT is written in all caps and is similar to the global variable in that it can be used throughout your application. The difference exists in the fact that it will warn you each time it’s being changed, so it’s a bit more visible than the global.
</p>
<h3>Class</h3>
<p>
Next up, the @@class variable allows you to keep track of class specific data that is also available across all of that particular classes instances. The primary use I’ve encountered is keeping track of particular class info such as how many instances have been made of a particular class, it becomes less useful for other types of functionality, as instance variables can cover the brunt of work needing to be accomplished.
</p>
<h3>Instance</h3>
<p>
The @instance variable is a special variable for use within the instance of a class. It’ll shift and morph with a particular instance, and won’t impact the class or other instances of that particular class. Use instance variables to keep track of any attributes within the instance of a class of your application. For instance, you may have a class Cars representing various cars and @color may be an instance variable of that class to signify that each car will have a different color.
</p>
<h3>Local</h3>
<p>
Last, but certainly not least, is the local variable. The local variable is a variable type that is for use within a particular area of a class. It is not very flexible so it won’t carry data over from one method to the next, but it does help with any functionality that only needs to be used within a particular function or method, such as a count, or for storing other information temporarily or as part of a return value.
