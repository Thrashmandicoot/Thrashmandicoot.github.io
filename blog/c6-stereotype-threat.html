This is a particularly complex issue, so this is my particular thoughts and feelings on is as of right now, and how I relate.
</p>
<p>
I have not experienced a racial type of stereotype threat, but I have experienced a form of imposter situation, especially when it comes to changing my situation, or interacting with a new group of friends.
</p>
<p>
Times in the past when attempting to bond with people, I feel very not apart of the group, and while this feeling is only temporary, and I’ve never had any major problems with joining particular people for various activities from gaming to socializing, it none-the-less shows up as a barrier when it comes to engaging in new activities.
</p>
<p>
For instance, I may come up with excuses as to why I don’t wish to participate within a group of people, or suddenly be busy with something else that day, when in reality I don’t want to confront the social pressure of that particular situation. It can be draining and taxing and comes from this mistaken idea that I’m not good with people because I grew up being a bit less social than others in my classes. In particular though. we may wish to see what aspects may hold a person back in this manner.
</p>
<p>
The first is sterotype threat, which is a particular experience where a person’s perceptions of their own negative group sterotypes prevents them from succeeding in something simply because they are aware of the thought. For instance, women thinking that they’re “bad at math/science” can impact those even exceptional at the topic into performing in a mediocre fashion, simply because they buy into the perception on a subconscious level.
</p>
<p>
Imposter syndrome is a similar phenomena in which the person cannot internalize their own accomplishments leading to this sense of self doubt that prevents them from succeeding in what they want to accomplish, even if they’re particularly good at that subject.
</p>
<p>
So what’s a particular strategy that seems to work in combating these ideas?
</p>
<p>
The first seems to be simply being aware that they exist, which can compound a bit of logical thought into knowing when one might be being affected by this. The awareness can trigger a rationalization of the situation.
</p>
<p>
What other strategies exist, and if you’ve suffered from these in the past, what’s worked for you?
