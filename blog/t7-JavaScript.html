    <h2>a few differences</h2>

    <p>
    There are quite a few differences between Ruby Classes and Javascript object constructors. We’ll cover a quick few.
    </p>
    <p>
    First, the Ruby Class is a lot more overt about how you bring it into existence. Your Ruby class
    will allow for default values using a method called initialize that gets called when the class is
    brought into existence.
    </p>
    <p>
    The initialize method is similar to the object constructor in that it can be used to set default values for an object. The difference lies in that javascript uses object properties similar to how Ruby uses keys in hashes, and Ruby uses instance variables which don’t have to be part of a key value pair (but could be).
    </p>
    <p>
    Javascript can store two types of variables, those variables are global variables and local variables. Ruby can store variables globally, as a constant, as a class variable, instance variable or local variable. These variable separations are helpful as you know an instance variable is always going to be specific to a class object, and while properties will also be specific to javascript objects, the naming convention used is much more subtle.
    </p>
    <p>
    I’ll cover these more in depth later.
