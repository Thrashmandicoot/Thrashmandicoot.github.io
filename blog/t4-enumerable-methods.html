    <h2>Using the Map/Collect Method</h2>
    <p>
      Map is an Enumerable method that allows you to transform an array's data. The
      way it works is by passing each value of an array into the map method, which
      then is transformed by the conditions you set.
    </p>
    <h3>An Example Use</h3>
    <p>
      Lets say you have an array of prices for various items you may own, and you
      want to see what the prices would be if you applied a 20% discount.
    </p>
    <p>
      ex array: </br></br>
      tshirts = [10.00, 15.00, 30.00, 15.00, 12.00]
    </p>
    <p>
      To use map, simply call it on the array like so:</br></br>
      tshirts.map {|x| x * 0.8}
    </p>
    <p>
      This would iterate through each price above, and multiply
      the value of each element by 80% (0.8) and return to you
      a list of your prices at 80% or, what they'd look like with
      a 20% discount. </br>
      The example above returns: </br>
      => [8.0, 12.0, 24.0, 12.0, 9.600000000000001]
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives us a quick way to modify the prices of our tshirts. One
      thing to note though, the map method won't modify the original array
      so our tshirts data is safe. However, if you wanted to apply the map
      results to the array permanently. That can be accomplished by using
      the destructive version of the map method map! </br></br>
      Like so: tshirts.map {|x| x * 0.8} </br></br>
      This would permanently modify the array for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please also note, that map, and collect, are effectively the same
      so either method you call (and their destructive equivalents) can
      be used interchangeably, though most developers typically use the
      map syntax.
