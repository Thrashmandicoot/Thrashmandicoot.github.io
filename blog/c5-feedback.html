    <h2>Q and A Reflection</h2>
    <h3>Pairing</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Q. What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
    <li>Very fun, a good test of not just my ability, but my abillity to communicate what I knew, and navigate through things I didn’t know.
    </br></br>
    <li>Q. Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
    <li>Coming up with ideas on how to solve a particular challenge, and working with my partner on expanding out the solution. It was neat seeing everything come full circle, work, and ultimately solve the problems, and vice-versa.
    </br></br>
    <li>Q. Was something frustrating and difficult for you?
    <li>The most frustrating part of pairing is knowing how something would work in your head, but not being sure on how to communicate that particular solution. A lot of the challenges for me weren’t based on not knowing what to do, but rather how to communicate what I did know.
    </ul>
    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Q. How did you feel when you read your feedback?</li>
    <li>Amazing. It was great to see how many people had a very positive experience with me, and the constructive feedback I did receive made sense.
    </br></br>
    <li>Q. Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
    <li>Feedback I received was very helpful, it helped solidify my feelings on the strides I was taking, and helped me see where I could use some extra work.
    </br></br>
    <li>Q. Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?
    <li>I’m going to make sure my partners know that our pairing sessions are still on. I typically set my appts well in advance, and while I do show up for them, I typically don’t communicate on the matter, but a few individuals expressed feedback that they wanted to ensure things were still on before the meeting time. So I’ll improve on follow ups.
    </br></br>
    <li>Q. How was it to write feedback?
    <li>Feedback was difficult to write. Primarily in cases where everything went extremely smooth and my partner was a blast to work with. If someone was awesome all around, it becomes harder to point out where they can improve, so I have to get really granular and point out areas that I feel would be most beneficial to them. It’s helpful to hear you’re awesome, but feedback should also be a tool to showcase where you can make steps to improve. Even if I enjoyed every second and didn’t feel there was any place my partner could improve, I challenge myself to find something so that they had something constructive to walk away with.
    </br></br>
    <li>Q. Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?
    <li>Feedback overall is an excellent learning tool, and is helping me glean greater insight into myself, and my ability to work with others.</p>
