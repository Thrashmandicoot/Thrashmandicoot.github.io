    <h2>Working on BootStrap</h2>

    <p>
      Bootstrap has been an interesting experience to implement. Part of implementing bootstrap has given rise to ideas such as as
      revamping the site into a Rails blog so I can work on Ruby and Rails, in part because of the building of a better posting system
      and in another part for just adding dynamic navigation that I can change in one area that reflects across the site (because copy
      pasta navigation is awful and not DRY at all....)
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, on the bootstrap build of my site, navigation has been implemented, along with a new footer model and jumbotron, challeneges
      remain alongside the CSS of the site overall, and getting the text etc. to display properly across all pages regardless of viewing
      device. I remain steadfast in this endeavour, but it's taken a bit longer than anticipated, so I'm going to delay rolling the changes
      out until they're complete and bug free.
