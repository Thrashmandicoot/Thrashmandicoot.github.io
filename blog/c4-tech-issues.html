    <h2>A brief look into a big problem</h2>
    <h3>Security in Tech</h3>
    <p>
      Years of advances in technology from web application development, to new
      ways of doing things has left many companies ill equiped to
      deal with the rising costs of maintaining legacy infrastructure. Lets
      first take a look at the risks involved.
    </p>
    <h3>The Risks</h3>
    <p>
      Having out of date legacy applications creates security vulnerabilities.
      First, consider the lack of developers maintaining applications, with less
      developers being hired on to maintain the code, means more ability for hackers
      and various malicious entities to gain access to sensitive data. With newer
      technologies and the rise in smart phones, it also means that employees of
      those companies can pose potential risks and increase potential leaks of
      sensitive data.
    </p>
    <p>
      An easy example of this can be seen if you look into what happened
      to Sony pictures when many of their movies, that hadn't even been exposed
      in previews, got leaked, allegedly from North Korea, but others speculated
      it could have been an inside job. Either way showcases the above mentioned
      risks.
    </p>
    <h3>The Costs</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, upgrading infrastructure is it's own beast. You can either
      pay developers to maintain, or build a new application and bridge the
      older data. Both methods cost a lot of resources, and while the most viable
      method is to upgrade the systems, the costs for doing so are often monumental
      especially if the company has been around a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is just a brief look at one of the bigger problems facing the IT world.
      While many companies are taking steps to bring their applications up to date
      there will be many that won't, and the management of risk will only play an
      increasing role in the future.
