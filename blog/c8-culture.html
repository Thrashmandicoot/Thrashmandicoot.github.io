    There was a time when I was living with a roomie, and my roomie had a friend over. I woke up from my sleep, but hadn't really come to, and my room mate noticed something dirty or annoying they found in the kitchen. I wasn't sure what they were upset about, but they were talking about me, within earshot, in the house I lived in to their friend as if I was the biggest jerk for doing this said thing, that they hadn't even talked to me about, but laid me out to their friend as if I was just some complacent jerk for not taking care of this thing.
    </p>
    <p>
    The problems with this scenario are multifold. First, I had no idea this was a problem, or a bother of my  room mate. Second, they were very aggressive in the manner than they were referring to my habits to their friend, and within earshot it made me feel unwelcome in my own home. I realized that this wasn't ok with me.
    </p>
    <p>
    I decided not to handle the problem that day, but knew it had to be resolved soon. I invited my room mate out for dinner the next day, and thought about how to resolve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    I figured that I needed to let them know why this problem bothered me, and why I felt offended that they had not brought this problem up to me, but felt it ok to talk to others as if they had. I needed to figure out a solution on how to resolve this communication issue for future instances, so I mapped out a way that we could talk to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
    The solution was that if there was a problem between me and my roomie, we would talk to each other outside of the home, because I always wanted the place we lived in to remain free from negative communication, so that it always felt positive to live and be a part of.
    </p>
    <p>
    I took my room mate to dinner, and after we had food and some good laughs, I told them I wanted to talk to them about the problem, and brought up that I didn't feel good being in my own home after they had told their friend negative things about me, I illustrated that I had no idea there was even a problem. They received it really well, and felt bad that things had gone the way they had, and agreed that they needed to come forward with problems and give me a chance to resolve the issue before talking about me negatively, especially within the home.
