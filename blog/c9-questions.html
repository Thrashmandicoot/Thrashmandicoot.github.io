    <h2>Being Specific</h2>

    <p>
      Asking the right questions involves asking a question in a way that solicits the answer that you want.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the idea of asking for what one may want may seem simple, in practice, it's a lot harder to do.
      Here's a quick and dirty breakdown of key points to a good question.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Be Specific ie:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the impact of your problem?</li>
        <li>Where in your code are you having the problem?</li>
        <li>What errors are showing up when your code runs?</li>
        <li>What specifically are you trying to accomplish?</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>

    <p>Basically, cut the question down to the most basic step you need to accomplish to make your code run.
      if you're starting a loop, and you have a particular variable that isn't updating, share an example
      of that loop that's failing, showcase that you've attempted to diagnose the problem yourself, perhaps
      with a printed statement of the variable that isn't updating, talk about solutions you've tried that
      have failed to resolve the problem.
    </p>

    <p>Adding these types of strategies should help out your question asking overall.</p>
