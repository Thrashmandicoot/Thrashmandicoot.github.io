    <h2>When to use one over the other</h2>
    <p>
      Today we're going to be going over Arrays and Hashes with syntax in the stylings
      of the Ruby programming language.
    </p>
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      An array is an integer index ordered collection of objects. Think of an array like the content index of a book. The contents of a book are typically listed top
      to bottom with the sections such as:
      <ul>
        <li>"Information about the Author"</li>
        <li>"Ch. 1 Introduction"</li>
        <li>"Ch.2 Why you bought this book"</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      An array of this might look like this (as you can see, similar structure):
      </br>
      </br>
      <ul>
        <li>content_index = ["Information about the Author", "Ch. 1 Introduction", "Ch.2 Why you bought this book"]</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we know about the layout, we can talk about the locations in the array.
      Arrays start at a location, or index of 0, this means content_index[0] would
      return "Information about the Author". content_index[1] would return "Ch. 1 Introduction"
      and content_index[2] would return "Ch.2 Why you bought this book". The index of the
      array starts at 0, and ends at 2 (a 3 length index). This index location how
      you would return things within your ordered array.
    </p>
    <h3>Hashes</h3>
    <p>
      Hashes are similar to arrays but are ordered using a key, which corresponds
      to a value. Building off of our example above, we may use a hash to order
      our chapters based on which page they're located on within our book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is our content_index using pages with a hash:
      </br>
      </br>
      <ul>
        <li>content_index = {5 => "Information about the Author", 10 => "Ch. 1 Introduction", 22 => "Ch.2 Why you bought this book"}</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In our content_index hash example above, we use integers to represent page numbers as keys, and those keys correspond to a value
      that is the chapter within the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we would call information similar to how we called information within an array
      instead of using an index location, we would use the key instead. For example content_index[5]
      would return "Information about the Author"
    </p>
    <p>
      When to use arrays vs hashes. As far as a our book example is concerned, using page numbers gives us far greater control over
      the location of that information within our book. But, we may not be looking
      for greater control, and instead just wanting to have a quick ordered list
      of the chapters, in this case an array would be the best choice. Really it comes down to how you're wanting to organize
      the information within the program and whether or not it makes sense.
