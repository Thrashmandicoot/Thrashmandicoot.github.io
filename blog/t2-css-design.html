    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>
      Classes serve as identification of elements in CSS. Typically classses
      are utilized with one or more elements that you're modifying with style.
      For example, you may wish to add a red background within multiple DIV tags
      located within your HTML, while you could utilize an ID to classify each of
      these elements, it's better to use classes, as IDs interact with javascript
      and javascript assumes that there will only be one ID of any given type on
      any given page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another important function of classes is that because they cover multiple
      elements, your website can pass validation if classes are used more than once
      where IDs you cannot pass validation with if used more than once (even though
      the style willl still load.)
    </p>
    <h3>IDs</h3>
    <p>
      IDs can be used similar to classes with the caveat of being used once per
      element. The use of IDs with DIV containers is common when specifying particular
      areas of your webpage, and in fact, before the advent of HTML5, this was considered
      common practice to have an IDs for things like your Navigation or nav div, a
      footer div, a header div, and so on. HTML5 now covers semantics on headers
      and DIVs, but the oldschool way will still work, and DIVs, and IDs can still
      be very useful for setting up particular looks on your page.
    </p>
    <h3>Recap</h3>
    <p>
      So remember, think of classes being used over and over again and IDs as being
      single use, and you'll be ahead of the game without having to put too much thought
      into it with your CSS. Catch you next time.
