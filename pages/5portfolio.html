              Welcome to my Blog! This blog was built utilizing Jekyll, javascript and jquery.
              It utilizes google analytics, and social share buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
              The theme is a modified version of <a href="http://blog.rainyalley.com/">RainyAlley</a>.

            <p>
              Gistter is about finding what your twitter network is up to on Github.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you go to Gistter, you're prompted to connect your twitter. Once
              you hit connect, you go through Twitter's OAuth, and Gistter then
              pulls in your tweets. Gistter then finds which of your tweets contain
              Github links, it then displays those tweets and then queries Github to find
              out all the repos those github users are contributing to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gistter utilizes the Angular JS framework and built to be a completely
              front-end application. OAuth is handled via oauth.io and styling is done
              with bootstrap.

            <p>
              Scene is about bringing local artists and businesses together to turn
              boring spaces into beautiful and meaningful Scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scene was my final group project at Dev Bootcamp. I got the experience
              of pitching the concept, getting it selected, and leading a team of
              4 other developers to build Scene from the ground up in less
              than 1 week.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scene was built utilizing the Ruby on Rails framework, Javascript, JQuery,
              Postgres, Google Maps API and a splash of Angular. It was styled utilzing
              Bootstrap, and Atomic CSS.

              <p>
                Battletracker is my independent research project from DBC. I chose
                to do my project in the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir programming language</a>
                to get a feel for a functional programming language. I built a website over a weekend
                utilizing the Phoenix framework.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're familiar with Ruby on Rails... C is to Ruby as Erlang is to Elixir and Ruby
                is to Rails as Elixir is to Phoenix.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall site was a lot of fun to build, and the Elixir language was
                crazy and interesting. I am definitely looking forward to
                see if the Elixir programming language takes off.
